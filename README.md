📘 README.md - MULTI-OS SETUP SCRIPTS

This repository contains 3 complete setup and configuration scripts for Ubuntu, Arch Linux, and Pop!_OS.
These scripts automatically install and configure a fully secure development environment with:

    Text-to-Speech (TTS) Tools
    Flask TTS API
    Virtualization (QEMU, VirtualBox)
    Docker & Docker Compose
    Advanced Security Setup (UFW, Fail2Ban, Root Lockout)

📂 REPOSITORY CONTENT
File	Description
setup_full_ubuntu.sh	Full setup script for Ubuntu (20.04, 22.04)
setup_full_arch.sh	Full setup script for Arch Linux
setup_full_popos.sh	Full setup script for Pop!_OS
README.md	Full documentation and usage guide
📋 EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS
🚀 STEP 1: GRANT EXECUTION PERMISSIONS

Run the following command to make the scripts executable:

chmod +x setup_full_ubuntu.sh setup_full_arch.sh setup_full_popos.sh

🚀 STEP 2: EXECUTE THE SCRIPT FOR YOUR OS

Run the appropriate script depending on your operating system:

🔷 FOR UBUNTU:

./setup_full_ubuntu.sh

🔷 FOR ARCH LINUX:

./setup_full_arch.sh

🔷 FOR POP!_OS:

./setup_full_popos.sh

🚀 STEP 3: VERIFY THE LOG FILE

After the script completes, review the log file to verify the success of the installation:

cat /mnt/data/testuser/setup_log.txt

        Generate audio files via a simple HTTP POST request

🐋 3. CONTAINERIZATION WITH DOCKER

    Docker Installation: Full Docker + Docker Compose
    User Added to Docker Group: No need to use sudo docker
    Service Activation: Docker service is enabled and started

🖥️ 4. VIRTUALIZATION (QEMU, VIRTUALBOX)

    VirtualBox for VMs
    QEMU and KVM for lightweight virtualization
    Libvirt for VM management
    Service Activation: Libvirt and KVM services are enabled

🔐 5. ADVANCED SECURITY SETUP

    🔥 UFW Firewall: Blocks all incoming connections except ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
    🔥 Fail2Ban: Protects from brute-force attacks
    🔥 AuditD: Tracks system security events
    🔥 AppArmor: Protects applications with security policies
    🔥 Root Lockout: Locks the root user account to block login access

📡 FLASK TTS API USAGE

The Flask TTS server allows audio file generation from a simple HTTP POST request.
The Flask server is a systemd service that runs automatically.
🛠️ SERVICE SYSTEMD COMMANDS

To check the status of the service:

systemctl status tts-server

To start/restart the service:

sudo systemctl restart tts-server

To enable the service on startup:

sudo systemctl enable tts-server

🧑‍💻 API USAGE EXAMPLE

Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/tts
Method: POST
Request Body (JSON):

{
    "text": "Hello, I am a voice generated by TTS"
}

Example cURL Command:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/tts \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text":"Hello, I am a voice generated by TTS"}' --output output.wav

Result: The output.wav file will be created and available for download.
🧪 TESTS AND VERIFICATIONS

The script automatically performs the following post-installation checks:

    ✅ Log file verification
    ✅ File and directory permission checks
    ✅ Service status checks
    ✅ TTS API endpoint testing

📋 TROUBLESHOOTING
Problem	Solution
Service not running	Restart the service: sudo systemctl restart tts-server
API not responding	Check the logs: cat /mnt/data/testuser/setup_log.txt
File permissions error	Fix permissions: chmod 644 /mnt/data/testuser/setup_log.txt

Docker issues	Restart Docker: sudo systemctl restart docker
🔐 SHOULD THIS SCRIPT BE OPEN SOURCE?

Opening the source code is generally safe.
Here are some security considerations:

    No sensitive information is exposed (like passwords or keys).
    The script uses best security practices (UFW, Fail2Ban, etc.).
    Review the script before sharing to ensure no hardcoded credentials.

If you plan to modify the script, ensure that no credentials are hardcoded and review any potential security vulnerabilities.
