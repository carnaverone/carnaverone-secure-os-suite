📘 README.md - Multi-OS Setup Scripts

This repository contains 3 complete installation and configuration scripts for Ubuntu, Arch Linux, and Debian-based systems (like Pop!_OS). Each script is designed to automate the installation of a complete development environment with advanced security, Flask TTS server, TTS tools, and Docker containers.
📂 Repository Content

    setup_full_ubuntu.sh : Script for Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, and later versions.
    setup_full_arch.sh : Script for Arch Linux.
    setup_full_popos.sh : Script for Pop!_OS and other Debian-based distros.

📋 Execution Instructions
1️⃣ Grant execution permissions to the scripts

chmod +x setup_full_ubuntu.sh setup_full_arch.sh setup_full_popos.sh

2️⃣ Run the script corresponding to your OS

For Ubuntu:

./setup_full_ubuntu.sh

For Arch Linux:

./setup_full_arch.sh

For Pop!_OS:

./setup_full_popos.sh

3️⃣ Check the log file

Each script generates a log file containing all the execution details.
To check the log, run:

cat /mnt/data/testuser/setup_log.txt

🚀 Script Features

    📁 Complete environment installation (TTS, security, Docker, Flask, virtualization)
    📜 Action logging (detailed log file of all actions)
    ✅ Automatic tests and checks (files, directories, permissions)
    🔐 Advanced security (UFW, Fail2Ban, root account lockout)
    📡 Flask TTS API server (generate on-demand audio files)

📋 Detailed Features
🛠️ 1. Installed Base Tools

    System packages: curl, wget, git, vim, nano, unzip, zip, htop, neofetch, net-tools
    Development tools: build-essential, python3-pip, openjdk, gradle
    Security tools: ufw, fail2ban, auditd, rkhunter, chkrootkit, lynis

🎙️ 2. Complete TTS System

    TTS tools:
        Coqui TTS
        Mozilla TTS
        MaryTTS
        eSpeak
        Festival
        Flite

    Flask TTS Server:
        Accessible via a REST API on port 5000
        Generate audio files via a simple HTTP POST request

🐋 3. Containerization with Docker and Docker Compose

    Docker installation
    User added to Docker group
    Docker service enabled at startup

🖥️ 4. Virtualization (QEMU, VirtualBox)

    VirtualBox (for full VM virtualization)
    QEMU and KVM (for virtualized environments)
    Libvirt for managing virtual machines
    Services enabled at startup

🔐 5. Advanced Security

    UFW Firewall:
        Blocks all incoming connections by default
        Opens ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
        Activates the UFW service
    Fail2Ban (to block brute-force attacks)
    AuditD (to track system security events)
    AppArmor (for application protection)
    Root account lockout:
        Locks the root user to block login access

📋 How to Use the Flask TTS API

The Flask TTS server allows you to generate audio files from a simple HTTP request.
The Flask service runs automatically as a systemd service.
🛠️ Systemd Service

The systemd service is automatically activated during installation.
To check its status:

systemctl status tts-server

To start/restart the service:

sudo systemctl restart tts-server

To enable the service at startup:

sudo systemctl enable tts-server

🧑‍💻 API Usage Example

URL: http://localhost:5000/tts
Method: POST
Request Body (JSON):

{
    "text": "Hello, I am a voice generated by TTS"
}

Example cURL command:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/tts \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"text":"Hello, I am a voice generated by TTS"}' --output output.wav

The output.wav file will be created and available for download.
🧪 Tests and Verifications

Each script performs automatic checks at runtime:

    Log file verification
    File permissions checks
    Service status checks
    TTS API endpoint testing

🔐 Is it safe to open-source this script?

Exposing this script as open source is generally safe.
However, here are some key points to consider:

    No sensitive information is exposed (passwords, tokens, or private keys).
    Server security best practices (like blocking the root user, enabling UFW, and using Fail2Ban) are followed.
    If you plan to modify or customize the script, ensure no credentials are hardcoded.
    Review for potential security holes, like unrestricted ports.
